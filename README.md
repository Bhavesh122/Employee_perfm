This website, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, serves as a tool for companies to assess employee eligibility for extra rewards based on task performance. When an employee inputs their task score and the total number of tasks completed, the system calculates eligibility. Scores exceeding 80 points and tasks completed exceeding 5 are deemed eligible for additional rewards.
